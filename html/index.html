  A List Of My Interests: <br>
  I don’t know if this will interest anyone, but I’m trying to understand how many things interest me.  So I’ve made a list, partly for fun, partly to help me understand, and, perhaps, focus in on some subjects a little better as time passes.
<br>
The list is quite long, but not exhaustive, and will probably grow over time as other things spring to mind.  Indeed, I’ve just thought of a few things I’ve missed!
<br>
My knowledge of the subjects listed ranges from a little to quite a lot, and tends to reflect the topics which are the flavour of a particular moment.
<br>
The Eclectic List
<br>
It’s in alphabetical order, not in any order of priority.  Regular readers of Italy Chronicles will recognise some of the subjects, others might come as a surprise, or not.
<br>
Advertising – methods and systems, and efficiency<br>
Animals and wildlife<br>
Art – contemporary art and artists – I like discovering interesting Italian artists
<br>Boats – all sorts, but especially hi-tech, high-speed ones – more on this lower down the list
Business – strategy, development
<br>Cars, Eco friendly engines, electric power, bio fuels, European, Asian, and American (I like muscle cars)
Coffee machines – Italian espresso makers, especially the coffee bar versions
<br>Cooking
Culture – what it is, how it differs and evolves
<br>Current affairs – news, views, and happenings in Italy and elsewhere
Design – combining function and form – why I like guitars, cars, motorbikes, tools, knives & guns
<br>Economics
English teaching – how to help people learn English, develop & consolidate their skills
<br>Environment – maintaining and enhancing it
Firearms – always found them fascinating.  Don’t really know why.
<br>Films and entertainment – Science fiction is my favourite genre
Food and drink – discovering new flavours, and nutrition
<br>Guitars – had a couple, cannot play them – love the sound, and the form, though.  Want an electro-acoustic Ovation model – one day.
History – modern history, but not only
<br>Intelligence – how we develop it, why some people are more intelligent than others, different types of intelligence, artificial intelligence
Internet, and related technology, css, php, web design
<br>Italy – anything and everything!
Journalism, including press freedom, citizen journalism
<br>Language – how we learn them, develop our skills, how to accelerate learning, grammar
Law, and legal systems (civil v common law), legal terminology
<br>Legends – and their origins
Marketing – web and traditional methods. Tourism and travel promotion via the internet
<br>Martial arts – Tai chi
Media and communications – differences between cultures, new techniques, especially use of www
<br>Mobile phones – technology, functions, operating systems
Motorbikes – big, fast ones (I’ve had a few moderately fast, but not big ones)
<br>Motor and motorbike racing – especially motorbike racing
Mountain biking, cycling, and bikes
<br>Music – many genres, including classical, rock, blues, acid jazz and some pop
Non-lethal weapons – I like the idea of being able to disable someone without killing him/her
<br>Paranormal events – ghosts
Photography, cameras, lenses, off-camera flash (I’m a novice at this) and photo editing
<br>Politics – political systems – particularly new ones!
Psychology – what it is, and how it effects out lives, and use of the www
<br>Real estate & architecture
Renewable energy – particularly solar energy, biomass & wave/ocean power generation systems
<br>Science – just about everything, much of which is mixed in with this list
Shooting – bows and arrows, crossbows, pistols, rifles, pea shooters, rail guns
<br>Space, space travel, and UFOs
Technology – web technology, computers, operating systems, applications
<br>Television – how it is used, how it can be used
Tools – love ’em (weird, I know!) – drills, spanners, saws, screwdrivers, soldering gear
<br>Travel – being in other places, not getting there!
Video games and gaming platforms – Wii, Playstation
<br>Walking – in the country or mountains up hills, but not down them!
Wine – particularly Italian wines and prosecco!
<br>Writing – techniques, writing for the web, trying to improve my own writing skills, and how to teach others to write
